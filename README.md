## Introducing HumAIn’s Open-Weight Model for Enterprise Scale Intelligence

We’re releasing an open-weight model from the HumAIn's stack.

This release is part of our belief that progress in AI should be shared, tested in the open, and improved through real-world use not locked behind closed doors.

The model is now available for anyone to explore, evaluate, and build with.

### What This Is

The HumAIn's open-weight model is designed to support real-time, conversational, and execution-oriented intelligence. It can be used for experimentation, research, education, product development, and applied use cases where understanding, memory, and action matter.

This is not a demo. This is a production-grade model, shared openly so the community can help shape what comes next.

### Why We’re Doing This

AI gets better when it’s used in the real world.

By releasing open weights, we want to:

• Enable builders to experiment freely  
• Learn what works and what doesn’t  
• Gather feedback from diverse use cases and environments  
• Improve the model faster through community insight  

Your feedback directly influences how HumAIn's evolve.

### Who Can Use It

This open-weight release is available to:

• Researchers  
• Students and educators  
• Startups and independent builders  
• Enterprises and institutions  
• Governments and public organizations  

There are no restrictions by industry or organization type.

If you can use it responsibly, you’re welcome to use it.

### How to Get Access

The model is readily available.

To request access:

1. Send us an email with a brief description of:  
   • Who you are  
   • What you plan to use the model for  
2. Our team will review and respond promptly  
3. Access will be provided immediately after confirmation
